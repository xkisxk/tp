## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

Test Feature
Currently, test feature is implemented on a systemwide level and is handled by `TestManager`.
Test allows users to test themselves on a single deck of their choosing or all decks at once.


Each user answer is saved as an Answer, which is added into an AnswerList. 
After the test ends, the program checks through AnswerList and compares each Answer 
to the corresponding FlashCard to check if the user’s answer is correct. 
Each time a test ends, the AnswerList is added to the TestHistory.
