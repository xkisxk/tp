## Introduction


CardLI is a desktop app to help you create, organising, and review flashcards via a Command Line 
Interface. As students ourselves, we find that studying through the use of flashcards can greatly
increase the efficacy of our study sessions as they break down large chapters and concepts into 
easy-to-understand segments. Hence, CardLI was designed in order to help students study better 
through the use of flashcards, while also reducing the paper waste that goes into writing our physical
flashcards. The interfacing within the application has been design to be interactive and functional,
while the commands were designed to be intuitive to use. 


## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `CardLI.jar` from [here](http://link.to/duke).
3. Take note of the full filepath of directory in which `CardLI.jar` is saved.
4. Open the command prompt by searching `cmd` in the search bar.
5. Navigate to the file directory containing `CardLI.jar` using the command `cd <filepath>`.
6. Start up CardLI using the command``java -jar CardLI.jar`.

The above steps are for users who are running CardLI on a Windows device. If you are using an Apple
and Linux device, you will have to open the command prompt equivalent on your operating system in step 4. 
Subsequently, you will also have to use the equivalent command on your operating system for 
navigation to a file directory in step 5. The remaining steps are the same across all operating systems.

## Features 
The current version of CardLI has two menus: main and deck. In the main menu, you are working with
all the decks, so commands only apply to the decks and not the individual flashcards. Enter the deck
menu to work with the flashcards.

Otherwise, the response will be marked as incorrect. Regardless of whether the answer is correct

cards which received incorrect responses.

## FAQs

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: In order to transfer the data on your decks of flashcards to another computer, simply transfer
the `CardLI.txt` file to your other computer, and download the latest version of CardLI there. 
Ensure that both the `CardLI.txt` and `CardLI.jar` files are in the **same directory** before running
the CardLI application in the command prompt as instructed under the Quick Start section. 

**Q**: Can I directly edit the `CardLI.txt` file to add, edit or delete decks and flashcards?

**A**: If you are familiar with the format of how the decks and flashcards are saved within the text
file, you are free to do so. However, if errors are generated upon the next start up of the CardLI 
application, you are advised to revert all changes to the text file and make the necessary changes
from within the application. We will only recommend this method if you are a veteran user and have a
good grasp of the application.
