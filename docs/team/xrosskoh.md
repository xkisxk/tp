## Overview
CardLI is a desktop app that helps you create, organise, and review flashcards via a Command Line
Interface. It is written in Java.

### Summary of Contributions

#### Implemented features
1. Added marking and scoring of tests

This feature marks a user's test and outputs the test score to the system output.
This feature will let users know the questions on which they have made errors, and use 
the test score to gauge their overall competency with the content on the flashcards.

2. Flashcard storage

This feature saves a user's decks of flashcards into an external `json` file after
each command. It also reads from the `json` file upon each startup of CardLI to
initialize the user's saved deck of flashcards. 
This feature provides users with access to decks of flashcards added in earlier
sessions without having to re-add then upon every startup of the application. 

3. Test history storage

This feature saves a user's test history into an external `json` file after each 
command. It also reads from the same `json` file upon each startup of CardLI to 
initialize the user's test history.
This feature allows users to view tests that they had previously done, including
tests that were completed during an earlier session. This can help them revise 
better by learning from mistakes made in past tests.
